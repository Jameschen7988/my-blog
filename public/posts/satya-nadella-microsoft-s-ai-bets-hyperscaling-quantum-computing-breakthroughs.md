我們可以交給人們哪些工具，讓他們感受到這種賦能的感覺？這正是我希望努力的方向。我不想將人工智慧擬人化。我更視其為一項工具。將會有一種職業叫做軟體工程師，這將會有所不同。當我這樣看時，你實際上是把一位軟體工程師視為現在的軟體架構師。我很高興歡迎微軟的董事長兼首席執行官薩提亞·納德拉。 [掌聲] [音樂] 謝謝。 [音樂] 這是主場觀眾。好吧，伙計。舊金山，你應該搬到西雅圖。我是在西雅圖開始我的職業生涯的。那是一個非常棒的地方。任何成功的人都會從微軟開始。沒錯。所以薩提亞，你之前強調過的 AI 將會影響我們所做的一切。在實踐中這會是什麼樣子？你知道，在微軟，這實際上如何驅動你的策略？特別是考慮到 AI 將如何影響超越目前令人難以置信的產品組合的想法，也就是微軟的更大經濟體系。我感覺我們是一家平台公司，產品公司，和夥伴公司。因此，我想到了這三個維度，在我的 35 年生涯中，我經歷過了客戶-伺服器，網路，行動，雲端，這是第四次變革，這就是我模式匹配的方式。我想的第一件事就是平台的機會，當我看到在場的所有人時，值得注意的是這些平台的綜合效應。這一 AI 的部分，正是我認為其擴散速度如此之快、如此廣泛的原因，因為它建立在上一代的基礎之上。我想到如果沒有雲端，我們就無法建立 AI 超級計算機，這進而導致模型，然後再到產品。因此，這種合成效果對我來說是有趣的，所以這就是為什麼你總是需要利用先前的平台來構建下一個平台，而你希望這能做到正確，然後你必須在其上建立下一代產品。每一次平台的轉變都有一個工作負載，當我第一次回想起看大型訓練任務時，我意識到這與我們為雲端建立的工作負載是完全不同的。這是一種數據並行的同步工作負載，與 Hadoop 任務等有很大的不同，因此平台。

### Satya Nadella <small>[03:07]</small>
平台本身會完全重新思考和改變。因此，對我來說，這就是平台方面令人興奮之處。正是系統軟體的黃金時代。坦白說，今天如果我必須思考任何一個在基礎設施層面上建設的人，不僅僅是超大規模的公司，甚至是初創公司，我都認為這是一個巨大的機會。顯然，模型方面和其上的產品也有巨大的機會。因此，我們考慮到這些，最終這一切都是為了什麼？就是促進經濟增長和GDP增長。如果我問我自己，對 AI 的基準是它是否在我們周圍創造了剩餘價值，一個社區，一個國家，一個行業，一個公司。這似乎是在應用層面上，你們為這麼多代人建立了定義性的應用程序。感覺我們處於這種古怪的震盪時刻，模型可能已經出現，我們對正在發生的事情感到驚訝，但然後，計算和應用程序需要實際趕上。而我們在這裡的希望實際上是這個房間裡的人將成為那些構建應用的人。是的，這是一個很好的問題，對吧？問題之一是模型是否像 SQL 一樣，還是 SAS 應用本身和模型？我的意思是，我覺得模型結束的位置和產品開始的位置在哪裡？因為如果你這樣說模型和一些支架以及工具調用在某種無限循環中是產品，那麼我覺得這是有點混淆的，但這就像說一堆 SQL 業務邏輯與 SQL，一個應用就是這樣。因此，我覺得對任何人來說，仍然是有可能在模型上構建應用層，而你必須抽象自己並說，對，模型對我來說就像 SQL 一樣。我一直夢想有一天 AI/機器學習會有一個 SQL 的時刻，因為如果你想一想，我們在過去從未有穩定的平台層，因為一切都是垂直構建和集成的，這次是在這個模型層上。現在我們有像 SQL 引擎這樣的東西，可以用來構建相當複雜的產品，這些技術也是如此。

### Satya Nadella <small>[05:47]</small>
這些技術也是如此，因為推理時間計算加上工具調用讓我們有了一個相當堅固的結構，能夠構建相當複雜的產品。是的，這有點瘋狂，集成部件也成為了應用層。是的，這只是，你知道，單獨坐著的模型非常聰明，但現在它們感覺上似乎有一個巨大的鴻溝，與對商業用戶真正重要的數據之間。這是一個很好的觀察，因為我認為至少我對情況的解讀是模型是一個重要的部分。模型的支架和所有這些工具調用，這就是，實際上你需要一個真正的應用伺服器，才能夠構建複雜的應用。這裡有趣的是反饋循環，數據在產品內部的路徑，然後用來進行後續訓練，以便能夠進行正確的工具選擇。這似乎是產品創造將要發生的地方。 AI 的擴展法律持續有效，對智慧的需求似乎是潛在的無限。昨天，伊隆提到會有 99 名超級智慧生物對 1 名人類，這是一個瘋狂的預測，但考慮到這一點，人工智慧未來的建設實際上點燃了全球計算基礎設施的需求。你如何預期隨著模型不僅變得更大，還變得更聰明，能夠進行複雜的多智能體互動而演變的這些需求？是的，我的意思是，如果你真的退一步並說，你知道，首先，如果你說計算或者智慧是什麼，如果計算的對數，那麼你問的問題是計算消耗的能量有多少？在美國可能今天是2％，最多3％，假設它翻倍，因此達到6％。這是巨大的，因為這樣的話，AI 使用所需的額外能量的產量相當高。我想這就是為什麼我們都必須時刻銘記，如果歷史教會我們一個教訓，那就是如果你要使用能量，你最好擁有社會許可去使用它。因此這意味著你必須確保這個 AI 的輸出是社會有用的。換句話說，如果我們真的沒有創造社會剩餘，經濟剩餘，根據國家和社區來衡量，那麼我們根本無法消耗能量。因此，對我來說，這是更大的一點，今天每個人都在熱衷與困擾著什麼，我該如何應對能源生產？我認為未來五年真正的問題是，我們必須生產足夠創造出巨大價值的產品，我對此非常有信心，尤其是在醫療保健和教育以及生產力方面，還有許多許多領域，但這才是真正的挑戰，對於我們科技行業來說，必須毫不模糊的證明我們所創造的東西是在真實統計數據中顯現的，而不僅僅是 AGI 或 AI 基準。我希望這能以某種方式顯現出來，成為你每日互動中的真實體驗，當你用到某個應用時，例如，你貸款的過程實際上不再需要三個月或兩個月的等待，而且不知道自己是否能獲得批准，或者有很多重要的生活部分被繁瑣的文書工作或官僚主義淹沒，這些東西將可能消失。100%。所以我認為，是的，如果你甚至考慮到一些公共服務，無論你帶的是任何國家的 GDP，還是像美國這樣的醫療保健成本，其實是我們成本的 18% 或 19%，大家都在談論神奇的藥物，但實際上所有的成本都在工作流程中，因此如果你真的考慮到一些簡單的事情，比如出院，取出一個 EMR 系統的後端，然後使用一個 LLM 與一個提示。這本身就會節省大量的時間、金錢和精力，最終彌補自身的成本。我是說，這是一個非常直接的狀況，對吧？你在醫療保健領域花費大量的 GDP，這是毫無疑問的。但每一塊花費在文書工作上的錢，原本都可以用于某種治療，而拯救某人的生命，或者簡單的一項醫生從文書工作中釋放出來，分配給患者的時間，那就在那裡可以被實現。

### Satya Nadella <small>[08:39]</small>
你認為今天 AI 部署最大的速度限制器是什麼？你看，這是很有趣的一點，對吧？而這個觀眾群是如此年輕，我的隱喻可能都不會奏效。但不管怎樣，如果你在上世紀80年代的早期說是某種外星智慧來了，看到我們怎麼工作的方式，非常驚訝，哇，這些人類在辦公室裡工作，他們擁有打字員，有滑行池，人們那時候使用紙張工作。然後，如果他們今天回來看到，老天，他們會說所有80億人都是打字員，對吧？這就是他們會得出的結論。因此，我認為發生的事情是我們所有人將會開始創建軟體，但會有一個叫做軟體工程師的職位，這將會有所不同，但我這樣看，你實際上是把一位軟體工程師看作現在的軟體架構師。這裡我還保留著你的元認知的意義，我的意思是，對我來說，最重要的一點是，手動編碼是太棒了，直到其做的事情讓我無法理解發生了什麼。因此這意味著我必須需要有我倉庫的元模型，正確知道發生了什麼，我正在查看變更日誌。因此，當我查看我的 GitHub 的時候，我最喜歡的功能就是能夠查看所有在我的代碼庫上工作的代理的完整變更日誌。我覺得這是在許多軟體開發中就像是一個偉大的開發經理一樣，我不知道你在微軟工作過的開發經理是誰，但我真的認為，開發經理的工作就是確保不會破壞構建，確保代碼質量好。對我來說這仍然是件事情，所以在所有 AI 代理的世界中，會出現一個抽象提升的階段，因為一件我們不談的事還有法律責任，直到一些真正的法律改變，法律責任將與人類和機構有關，人類構建的東西。因此，只要這一點存在，我們就必須確保人類在基本層面做到這些，這意味著我們需要許多工具來確保人類參與其中，以了解這些東西在做什麼。在 AI 開發中，你會看到許多的東西，你認為科技行業從你所站的立場上怎麼樣被低估的，還有被過分炒作的東西。毫無疑問，這方面的過度炒作。讓我這樣說，我們在這個行業中總是身處 AI 的熱潮之中。對我們所有人來說，我們的生存與獲得對新事物的狂熱是息息相關的，對吧？那就是史蒂夫·喬布斯的說法或鮑勃·迪倫的說法，你不是忙著誕生就是忙著死亡。最好是忙著誕生，這是好的。我認為我們作為技術社區最需要擔心和努力的事情是，我們如何獲得這種社會許可。如果有一件事情我覺得，對我來說，其中一個我看到的演示完全令我震驚，這發生在23年初，當時我在印度，看到一位當地開發者使用連鎖技術，基本上是把GPD3或GPD35與一些印度堆棧的語音到文本、文本到語音的開源項目連接起來，然後展示一下當地的印度農民如何能夠使用一個在 WhatsApp 中建構的聊天機器人，以便能夠獲得一些農業補貼，通過進入政府網站。這對我來說真是不可思議，我覺得，哇，怎麼會有這樣一個在美國西海岸上構建的東西能夠如此迅速地達到一個實際的用例，這要歸功於擴散的速度和實際上到處都互動的人們。這就是需要告訴的故事，實際上市面行情的故事。這是我認為被低估的故事，因為現在過度炒作的事情是模型能力，模型能力固然精彩，但如果我們能夠讓世界認識到這在每個人的生活中都產生了真實的變化，那麼我們的形勢就良好。如果這並未發生，那就只是我們公司的估值的問題，而這與行業重複，這不會有好結果。我喜歡這個例子。我的意思是，微軟似乎充滿了這樣的例子，能夠降低門檻，讓更多人能接觸到技術。你可以說，GitHub Copilot 便是其中最突出的之一。對，還有另一個你提到的例子。世界銀行在尼日利亞進行了一項研究，然後他們將其推廣到秘魯或智利，南美的某個地方。你知道，我們在微軟一直在努力尋求如何能對教育進行干預，這一直是一個夢想，我們在這方面努力十多年，確實有些成效。但這項研究表明，像 co-pilot 這樣的介入可能是非洲或拉丁美洲教育上最佳的科技干預，這就是我們所有在科技界心中夢想著的事情，現在這就在我們的掌握之中。

### Satya Nadella <small>[11:24]</small>
those inter office memos would be annotated and a forecast would come hopefully before the quarter end. And then suddenly people said with email and PCs and Excel they said let's print your like let me just send an Excel spreadsheet in email people enter number and you have a forecast. So what happened was the work the work artifact and the work flow changed. That is what needs to happen with AI. when someone says I I I I'm going to now do my job but with whatever 99 agents that I am directing on my behalf the workflow is not going to be constant uh right I mean you now are really going to have to change even the scope of your job is going to change so that change management is a real rate limiter right because you're now taking the means of production in an insurance company in a financial services company in a healthcare company in a software company and saying we are going to change everything uh in the way we work in fact we're going to change what jobs they are like you know at LinkedIn I think they took multiple of these functions uh the design function the front-end engineer function the product function put them all together and said we're going to have full stack builders uh that's a change in scope of even a job and so how do you then rebuild the product team with new roles new scopes and what have you. That's to me more the social rate limiter. Not that there's lots of other things around deployment of this technology, getting it out to the world, power is one, there are other issues, but I would say change management when I look at even a lot of the AI startups when I talk to them, everyone has now you know you worked at Palunteer so you know this uh everyone has forward deployment engineers. That's like the exciting thing is the palunteer model which I think is a fantastic model and why is that? That is because of that change management. Uh because I think you really need to help customers partners really understand the benefits of any product you're creating but not just the technology but even how to use the technology in a workflow. At YC, we have this uh funny saying that we tell a lot of people here to do, which is um you know, these are some of the smartest uh AI researchers, computer scientists who are just starting out in their careers. We tell them uh go undercover. So go work as a medical biller and see to what degree how many you know quote unquote knowledge work jobs are actually copying pasting from a browser into a spreadsheet into an email and then

### Satya Nadella <small>[13:59]</small>
spreadsheet into an email and then clicking send and do that for a while and realize like actually these are not necessarily you know using your prefrontal cortex and your highest mind kind of jobs like these are not you know can you imagine so many people like their lives are basically like you We used to we used to, you know, coming up uh at our age, we would call it paper pushing, but you know, they're not paper pushing anymore, but they're sending emails. You know, they're not sending faxes anymore, but they're trying to get business done by like attaching files to things. You know, that seems like a pretty big shift actually that they can Yeah. I mean I I mean I think one of the most understated things as an opportunity for anyone creating products or fundamental breakthroughs um even at the model layer is the amount of drudgery there is in knowledge work right I mean I mean in software engineering we saw that I mean the amount of you know we're taking the joy out of software engineering because you know you were out of your flow uh to be able to stay in the flow to be able to complete a task uh that itself is a great example of what I think is going to happen to all knowledge work. You're absolutely right. The amount of cycles you spend out of band uh collecting information because if you think about the prefrontal cortex and the synthesis part uh you know the amount of time you spend there is pretty low now like having a sophisticated reasoning model and your prefrontal cortex work together. Uh whereas a lot of the mundane stuff is getting done by even some ka agent or what have you. That I think is definitely the frontier. So beyond simply adopting AI tools, uh what are the biggest transformational shifts you're seeing in the field today? I think to me um even like I mean look this field is changing so rapidly right I had not even imagined last year even this time that we would get this far with RL um and with basically test time compute. uh and it seems sort of pretty limitless. So the way I think about it is pre-training worked. Uh all the post-training techniques on top of it were fantastic. Then this inference time compute seems to have really added uh in under a massive scaling law. So now I'm interested in whether there is some new algorithmic breakthrough. uh because I always say this entire regime could be changed by one person here who comes up and says I have a more efficient thing to do or a way to do this stuff right so that's you have to be open-minded that

### Satya Nadella <small>[16:34]</small>
that's you have to be open-minded that the last big breakthrough algorithmically has not yet been found uh so that's one um I'm always sort of interested in that the other one is what is the next step up uh right because what is the pre-training to RL um the end toend training loop that's the next you know big sample uh that I think is also what I think will happen in the next year uh so I would say what if that is another scaling law breakthrough because we will be like if you sort of take any lab now all of us I think will be working on saying what's a more integrated response reasoning model that we can build u and that I think is going to be the interesting piece there's something very interesting here I think in that uh if you think about like an LLM instance as a consciousness which I think some people are starting to say uh you know it's sort of instantiated you do a bunch of work with it and then it sort of goes away and you open a new chat box and it's you know I guess I'm curious like do you think that that might be one of the things that needs the loop needs to be completed right that like yeah I mean so I'm not sort of I don't to me this artificial intelligence is unfortunately the worst name we could have ever picked. And so I'm not into this anthropomorphizing AI at all. I mean I think of it more I come at it as it's a tool. It's not trying to replicate how we think. Uh it is it it's definitely showing signs of intelligence but it's not uh intelligence that I have and I think of human agency still will matter will be there and we will sort of use these as tools. So that's kind of my position. That said, let's just say oh yeah, a memory system uh is a good thing. Uh these things do need if I look at the next frontier, I would say there are three things, right? One is memory. Uh the other one is tools used. And then the third which I think is perhaps the most important thing is entitlements. Uh which is basically if I'm going to take action, what entitlements do I have to take action? Right? So these three systems have to be built as first class around the model in order for us to build more sophisticated applications. One of the uh arguments people are starting to make around the future of software is well we have the database and then you're going to have uh basically middleware that is you know I think you know what you call entitlements you it's kind of like access control list like you know what's the business logic who gets to do what and then you know you you basically put

### Satya Nadella <small>[19:11]</small>
and then you know you you basically put the agent on top there um you is that sort of that's right so that that's why I think about like know people say when you think about the scaffolding layer right you have a model plus scaffold scaffolding the scaffolding now really gets first class by thinking of these three things uh tools use is one memory is one and then entitlements and you put that stuff together then you can create an agent an agent has an ID uh agent has management and provision control on it it has you know so that's the way I think to think about it do you worry with codeg genen like would do you think users at some point will just prefer to uh make software just in time instead of using package software. I mean that's something that uh you know we having lots of conversations in the hallway about that because a lot of us in this room you know YC will actually fund a ton of SAS and will continue to do so but you know in the background we're starting to have that worry. There's some venture capitalist friends of mine who are in the audience. They're actually like I actually don't know if I can continue to fund B2B SAS. How do you think about that? Yeah, it's a great question. I mean you know it's it's interesting. Um at the same time uh I look at the number of people who are forking VS code and I say man we must have done something right. Um and u so therefore there is something to be said about building a great um uh IDE um in fact when I think about Excel I think of it as an IDE. Uh so the fact that there's a great canvas uh you can then then bring let's call it the best analyst model to this IDE uh and then create a loop between the canvas and the uh model. Uh so I think yes you can generate applications just in time uh you could have a prefabbed application that is really helping with the feedback loop to the model and I think both of these things will exist together. Do you think there's a role for design in all of this? I mean, basically a h, you know, a human being sitting in front of VS Code uh is sort of like the translator between, you know, the software and what the end user really wants. And then I think some of this idea that software goes away presupposes that just, you know, normal people walking around are going to want to create software. And, you know, I don't know if that's going to work. I think that's a good point. So I think the way I sort of say um because one of the the basic question you're asking is what happens to software engineering right I

### Satya Nadella <small>[21:46]</small>
happens to software engineering right I mean that's the let's take the following uh thought experiment right if you sort of said some Martian intelligence came um in uh the 1980s and watched how we all worked oh wow these humans kind of work in the offices and they have a typist pool they have a slide pool and people then work with paper And then if they came back today they'll say god man all eight billion people are typists now right I mean that's what they'll uh sort of you know surmise and so I think what I think will happen is all of us are going to be creating software but there is going to be a job called a software engineer it's going to be different but I look at it right you you you are really taking a software engineer and saying you're now a software architect right see the I I still the metacognition of your I mean one of my biggest things is man Wipe coding is fantastic until it does stuff that I don't know what the heck happened. Uh so that means I have to have the meta model of my repo and exactly what happened and I'm looking at the change logs right. So when I look at the my favorite feature of GitHub now is to really look at the complete change logs of all the agents that are working on my repo. uh and I think that is where a a lot of the software engineering will be like a good dev manager right I don't know who which dev manager you worked at Microsoft but I really looked and and a dev manager's job was to make sure builds don't break and the code has got good quality um and so to me that is still a thing uh and so there will be a level of abstraction uplift uh even in a world of all of AI agents because one thing that we don't talk about is the legal liability by the way until some real laws change are going to be with humans and institutions humans build. Um, and as long that is true, we're going to have to really make sure the human is in the loop uh at a fundamental level. And that means we will need a lot of tools for humans to be in the loop in order to figure out what these things are doing. In AI development, you see so much, you know, what do you think is underestimated and uh, you know, and what is overhyped by the broader tech industry from where you're sitting? It's not short of overhyping. Let me just put it that way, right? We're at the uh everything is AI all the time. So, it's good. Uh you know, for us all in this industry, we live and die by our ability to get into a frenzy about something new, right? What is the Steve Jobs thing or the Bob

### Satya Nadella <small>[24:14]</small>
What is the Steve Jobs thing or the Bob Dylan thing, which is you're either busy being born or busy dying. It's better to be being busy being born. So, that's good. The I think the thing that we have to most um worry about and most work on as a as a tech community I would say is that how do we earn that social permission? If there is one thing that I feel to me one of the demos I saw which completely really blew me away was I think in the beginning of 23 um when I was in India and I saw a local developer Daisy chain essentially at that time either GPD3 or 35 uh with one of these India stack speechto text texttospech uh open-source things and then showed a local Indian farmer who was able to sort of use a a chatbot that was built in WhatsApp uh to be able to get some agricultural subsidy, right? Uh by going to a government website. That to me was unbelievable, right? I I I felt like, man, how could something that was built in the west coast of the United States get to a real use case that fast uh thanks to sort of the diffusion rate and basically people uh everywhere. That is the story that needs to be told uh right at scale. Uh that is the underhyped story I think because right now the overhyped thing is the model capability and the model capability is fantastic but man if we can somehow get the world to recognize that this is making a real difference in the lives of people everywhere we're in good shape. If that doesn't happen, this is all about some valuations of us uh our companies and our industry and it's the same repeat then that is not going to end well. I love that example. Um I mean you can I don't it feels like Microsoft is sort of full of examples of things that uh lower the floor so that you know a lot more people can get access to technology. I mean you could argue go GitHub Copilot is one of the biggest. Yeah. By the way, one of the other ones just you brought it up. There was a World Bank study they did, I think in Nigeria and now they've taken it to Peru or Chile, one of those in in South America. It's, you know, we've been working at Microsoft forever on can there be an intervention in education, right? That's been the dream, man. We've been at it at it for decade after decade and it's made a difference. uh but this study said by access to something like a co-pilot is probably the best tech intervention in education uh in Africa or in Latin America and that's you know that's been the dream I think that we've all had in tech and it's right there

### Satya Nadella <small>[27:01]</small>
現在這就在我們的掌握之中。我很好奇，因為你知道，你的 co-pilot 在 Windows 中是一個常見的事情，在科技界，有人可能對最新的前沿模型非常著迷，但卻容易忘了，Windows 與 Windows 的整合實際上是人們第一次接觸到的 / 前 AGI 類似的 AI 的互動。從人們使用這一切中，有沒有什麼觀察？是的，不，我們對 Clippy 作為 co-pilot 重出江湖非常興奮。但認真說，我的意思是，對我來說，儘管我們使用的形式似乎老土，像是一台舊電腦搭配滑鼠和鍵盤，但夢想一直是，實際上，比爾在1995 年建立的微軟研究第一個研究小組是語音。自那時以來，我們一直在思考，天啊，何時語音才能在 PC 上成為一流技術。但現在，借助 Copilot，對我來說，兩件事是相當超現實的，就像是新的瀏覽器時刻，對吧？同時存在著視覺和語音。 我把它總是開著。它能看見我所見，而我可以跟它講話。這對我來說就像是一種精確的滑鼠運動。因此，我認為即使在現有的形式上，也可以改變整個電腦的使用，然後會有新的形式出現。這是令人興奮的時刻，讓我們可以構建和修改現有的硬體，以便在計算使用方面看到可能性。是的，計算使用的迷人之處在於，你擁有智慧，而計算使用實際上是你所有數據的超集，像是你的個人數據、工作數據，你所有的辦公文檔，所有的一切都能触及。那麼，電影《她》的描述是正確的嗎，操作系統會嵌入你最信任的代理中？是的，我認為這一直是夢想，那就是這些代理能否成為你的電腦，並為你執行計算。這絕對是我認為未來的方向。我覺得你提到的最核心的點就是信任。可以相信這個去委託我想要的東西，而這意味著精準性，這通常涉及隱私，這也是諸多考量的一部分，我認為這一切最終都有必要解決。

### Satya Nadella <small>[29:53]</small>
我是說，在這方面，你知道，當你看看你們的公司，還有你可以說蘋果，他們必須在保護全世界電腦用戶的隱私方面站在前線。是的，對我們來說，這裡有許多問題，隱私、安全、主權，這三個是非常重大的考量，對每位用戶來說，隱私是他們所關心的，安全則是每個租戶或客戶在隱私之外所關心的，然後每個國家會關心主權、安全和隱私。因此，這是思考的方式。因此，你要建造任何產品或系統，必須能夠回答人們、組織和國家在這三個邊界之間如何運作的問題。薩奇，你在微軟的旅程非常不凡，從工程師一直做到首席執行官。你會跟下一代建設者分享哪些旅程中的教訓？沒有一個人會在某段旅程開始時就有一個明確的目標，想要達到哪裡，但你開始的時候，的確有一個目標，就是在首位取得成功，並讓自己享有最高的抱負來完成你想做的事。對吧？我總是說，這不意味著我在等待成為 CEO 才能做出我最好的工作。我在'92 年進入公司時，第一份工作給我的感覺是我能有的最棒的工作。我覺得如果我這樣就這樣退休，那也太好了。當我回想起來，這是一個很好的心理模型。事實上，我並不在等待下一個升遷去做某事，而是利用我所獲得的機會去完成所有我能做的事情。我認為這正是那些正在起步或是創業者、研究者、學生在今天所擁有的。所以我會說，將這份抱負保持在心中。不要等到下個大事情出現，善用擁有的事情，把它變得更大。然後我還想說，大事情是要透過你的團隊來實現的。學會如何在團隊中工作，讓團隊變得優秀。我覺得我在微軟學到的一件事就是如何參與一個項目，什麼是合作。事實上，這就是學校和工作的最大區別。當你加入團隊後，需要弄明白如何讓團隊成功。而激勵措施其實是相當明確的，除了我認為最少考慮到的事情是，如何確保你能夠組建一個團隊，而在這個團隊中的角色是什麼。每個人都會望著其他人的工作，認為是其他人的責任去調整團隊，其實是你的工作去調整這個團隊。如果我要總結這兩個要素，就是對自己影響的高抱負，以及如何在團隊中工作，使團隊變得有效，這就是魔法。這邊有個有趣的故事，其實我學會了如何作為 Windows Mobile 的 PM 進行產品管理和項目管理。當我在 Palunteer 工作的時候，我是第 10 位員工，我教他們如何運行零缺陷項目，所有的 PM 訓練轉變成創建 Palunteer 如今的產品組織，這相當神奇。因此，就此感謝微軟。

我很好奇，你在尋找什麼樣的品質，因為 AI 正在成為創意工作和工程工作的關鍵一環，這也在改變你面試某人的方式及評估他們的技術或較廣泛的技能。是的，我的意思是，我總在尋找人們的三種品質。首先，實際上你知道，比爾讓我了解到這一點，他曾在某個時候描述過什麼是好建築師，什麼是壞建築師。他有一種很好的方式進行概述，就是好建築師帶來清晰，而壞建築師帶來混淆，即使他們同樣聰明。我尋找的人是那些能夠天然在不確定和模糊的情況下進入並帶來清晰度的人，這是一種被低估的素質。你只需思考一下你每天進行的討論數量，關於某些困難的情況，困難的背景，能夠帶來關於下一步該做什麼的清晰度的人是稀缺的，所以我總是在尋找那些在不確定時期能夠帶來清晰度的人。第二， 我所尋找的是能夠創造能量的人。換句話說，我不是說他們僅僅帶來了能量，也是真正能夠使各種相關方聯結在一起的人。任何如果有誰來對我說他們的團隊很棒，其他人都不如他，那樣的人其實是毫無意義的。我需要能夠在公司內部、外部建立聯繫並創造能量的人，這是我的需求。最後，我所尋找的是能夠解決過度約束問題的人。因此，我最喜歡的面試問題就是問某人描述他們參與過的一個項目，真的走不通了，但他們找到了路徑。同樣，問題嘗試的方式，因為本質上，成功的人是如何行動的，他們能將過度約束問題轉化為可解決的問題。這三個魔法般的元素，帶來清晰度、創造能量及解決過度約束問題所帶來的成功正是我認為領導力的精髓。但領導力並不是你在生活晚期才展現的，你在每一步中都在做著。因此，我想簡要講講量子。我是說，你們剛剛在二月推出了 Majorana 1。這與 AI 的未來有沒有關聯？我估計這裡可能有一些量子研究者非常感興趣。因此，我很好奇未來會怎樣。對我來說，看到正在發生的事情是非常令人興奮的。我們參與了這項工作，已經快20年了，我是微軟第三位對量子技術進行投資的 CEO。我們一直在朝著量子的目標發展，夢想或集中在一個方向上，就是如果我們真想建立一台量子電腦，它是一台通用計算機，那麼你必須解決非常穩定的量子位和自錯誤量子位。因此，一個容錯的量子計算機，我們對這一基本物理特性進行了投資，而這是由意大利物理學家Majorana想出來的。因此，這促使我們對此戰略進行努力，現在我們能夠成功製造這種粒子。所以我們感覺我們需要達成的巨大成就已經實現。而我的想法是，如果你想理解自然的語言，那就是仿真。我認為理解最好的方法是通過量子計算，畢竟，物理和自然本身就是量子。因此，我認為 AI 就是這個模擬器的仿真器，這也是一個方式去使用 AI，結合高性能計算。事實上，我們所看到的很多進展，包括使用 HPC 加上 AI 來加速化學、物理和材料科學的進步。而量子技術將是下一步。但我們對 AI 與量子以及 HPC 組合的潛力非常激動。非常酷！我們的時間不多了，我感覺如果我們再有一個小時，我們可以討論更多的問題，要結束了，我想聽聽你的看法。讓我們模擬一下，你現在22歲，在微軟的level 59，你剛剛畢業。考慮到2025年，你會做什麼呢？如果你重新開始，知道你現在知道的內容，你會專注於什麼？你會如何著手，對什麼感到興奮？如果回頭看看微軟的歷史，Office 的建立是一個令人難以置信的故事，考慮到這些工具，一個文字處理器、一個電子表格，一個幻燈片工具，這些工具對我們的意義。我一直這麼說，如果有人問我我最喜歡的產品，那就是 VS code 和 excel。我就是對這些工具的使用感覺良好。一切都是關於你擁有的賦能感，數字的感覺，以及透過這些簡單的表格獲得的分析能力，多麼的突破。因此，我想要工作於接下來的工具，看到像 Copilot 這樣的東西，這就是我想要的地方，因此，我相信要打造這些能給予人們賦予的工具正是我所希望投入的，這些創造者正坐在此時此刻的觀眾中。請給薩奇娜德拉熱烈的掌聲！非常感謝。謝謝！不可思議。[音樂]

across the company outside the company create energy right innately and then the last thing is people who are good at solving over constrained problems that's why I think my favorite interview question always is um asking someone to describe like a project they worked on which really was going nowhere and they figured out a path right and the way they go about it uh problems solving uh because essentially what are what do people do who are successful? They take an over constrained problem and figure out how to unconstrain it. Um and that magical sort of three things right which is bringing clarity, creating energy and driving success by solving over constrained problems is what I think leadership is about. But leadership is not about something that you do later in life. You do it every step of the way. Uh I want to cover quantum briefly. I mean you guys just released your um Majorana 1 in February. Um is there an interaction um with the future of AI and you know I think there are probably some quantum researchers in the house. So curious what the future will be. Yeah to me it's pretty exciting to see what's happening. I mean we've been at it man for like it's like I'm the third CEO at Microsoft who's been writing checks on quantum. Um um and we've been at it for 20 plus years and the dream at least or the focus we always had was if we really want to build a quantum quant computer which is a general purpose computer uh you got to solve u for really stable cubits um and error corrected cubits um so a fault tolerant quantum computer and we bet on this bas basically a physical property which was envisioned by these Italian physicists Mayorana and that is what uh we went after and finally we've had a physics breakthrough and we were able to actually fabricate that particle and so therefore uh that's what has led to this chip. uh so we feel like one of the big things that we needed to achieve uh has been achieved and the way I think about it is if you say um takes you know if you want to understand the language of nature which is simulation um I think the best way to do it is through a quantum computer because after all uh you know physics and nature is quantum and so therefore but AI is I think of it as an emulator of that simulator right so that's another way to uh perhaps even use AI today with HPC. In fact, a lot of what we are seeing is pretty good advances in uh using um basically HPC plus AI as a way to accelerate advances in chemistry, in physics, in material science. And so

physics, in material science. And so quantum would be the next step in it. But we're very excited about what AI plus quantum and HPC in a loop can do. Very cool. Uh we're running out of time. I feel like we could go for another hour if we if we had the time. Um, so just to close, I just wanted to get your sense. You know, let's do a simulation of a sort. You know, you're uh 22 years old and you're level 59 at Microsoft. You're starting your career. You just graduated. Um, what are you working on given, you know, in 2025? You know, if you started over knowing what you know now, what would you be working on? How would you be approaching it? you know what would you be excited about? If you look back at the history of Microsoft, how office got built is a you know it's an unbelievable uh story in the sense of thinking of these tools um right a word processor a spreadsheet a slidem tool um what those tools are meant to all of us right I mean I mean ex I mean that's why I always say what's your if somebody asks me what's my favorite product it's always you know VS code is one and the other one is excel out. Uh it's just your you feel so good when you use the tool. It's all about the sense of empowerment you have, the numbers sense you have, the analytical power you have with something simple like a spreadsheet like what an unbelievable scaffolding uh it is right uh columns and rows with some sort of tuning machine in the middle um is just breakthrough. And so I would want to work on what are the next set of tools like when I see even copilot today that's kind of where I feel like you know researcher analyst creator these are like the word excel powerpoint right every day I go to them so to me that's what I would love to what are the tools that we can put in the hands of people that will give them that sense of empowerment that's what I would love to work on I have a feeling the people who make those tools are sitting in in this audience right now. Please give it up for Sachin Nadella. Thank you so much. Thank you. Incredible. [Music]
